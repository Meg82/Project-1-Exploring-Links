	My dad has always had a habit of watching old sci-fi and western movies on the weekends. When I was maybe ten or eleven, one Saturday or Sunday, he let me watch <i>The Thing</i> with him. It was exciting, infatuating, and I couldn't look away. I remember that, near the end of the movie, my mom came into the living room and yelled at my dad for letting me watch it. She made him change the channel because she didn't want me watching something so gory and violent. Sorry Mom, but I still remember.
